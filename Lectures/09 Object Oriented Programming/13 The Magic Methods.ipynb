    "Magic methods in Python, often referred to as special methods, are a set of predefined methods you can use to enrich your classes. They are easily recognizable by their double underscore prefixes and suffixes (e.g., `__init__`, `__str__`, `__add__`). Despite being called \"magic,\" there's no actual magic involved; instead, they represent the Python data model's hooks. These methods allow you to emulate the behavior of built-in types, perform operator overloading, and interact with Python's most fundamental features.\n"

    "- **Object initialization and destruction** (e.g., `__init__`, `__del__`)\n",
    "- **String representation** (e.g., `__str__`, `__repr__`)\n",

   "cell_type": "markdown",

    "One of the most powerful aspects of magic methods is their ability to make instances of your custom classes behave as if they were built-in types. This includes not just behaving like containers (such as lists or dictionaries) or numbers (integers or floats), but also integrating with key Python concepts like context managers (via `__enter__` and `__exit__`) and iterables (via `__iter__` and `__next__`).\n"

    "For instance, by implementing `__iter__` and `__next__`, your custom objects can be looped over with a `for` loop, just like lists or tuples. By defining `__getitem__`, your objects can support indexing and slicing operations. This deep level of integration blurs the line between the built-in types and the custom types you create, allowing for a more cohesive and intuitive experience for both developers and users of your code.\n"

    "Moreover, these special methods are not called directly by your code (you don't do `my_object.__str__()`), but by Python itself. When you attempt to turn an object into a string, Python will automatically look for a `__str__` method and use it if available. This implicit behavior is what gives these methods a feel of \"magic,\" enriching the standard protocol for how objects behave within the Python ecosystem.\n"

Understanding and utilizing these methods allows developers to create objects that work seamlessly with Python itself, promoting code that is both elegant and idiomatic. By embracing magic methods, you unlock a deeper level of interaction with the language, enhancing both the functionality and interoperability of your custom classes."

    "1. **Reference Counting**: Python primarily uses reference counting as part of its memory management and garbage collection scheme. Each object keeps track of how many references exist to it. When you create an object and assign it to a variable, its reference count becomes 1. If you create another variable that references the same object or pass the object into a function, the reference count increases.\n",
    "\n",

If `resource_instance` was the only reference to that object (making the reference count zero), Python knows that the object is no longer accessible or needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Invoking `__del__`**: If the reference count of an object reaches zero, indicating no more references to the object exist, the `__del__` method (if defined) is triggered. It's Python's way of telling you that the object is about to be destroyed. This is where you can place any clean-up code, like closing files or network connections associated with the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Garbage Collection and Object Deletion**: After `__del__` has been executed (or if it wasn't defined, after the reference count reaches zero), the garbage collector removes the object from memory. This step is handled automatically by Python, and you usually don't need to intervene or worry about it. \n"

  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "It's also worth mentioning that Python has a more complex garbage collector beyond just reference counting to handle specific scenarios (like circular references that reference counting alone can't resolve). This garbage collector runs periodically and cleans up objects that are no longer accessible even if their reference counts aren't zero due to referencing each other.\n"
   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",

    "In summary, `del resource_instance` reduces the reference count, possibly triggering the `__del__` method if the count reaches zero, and then Python's garbage collector handles the actual object deletion from memory.
