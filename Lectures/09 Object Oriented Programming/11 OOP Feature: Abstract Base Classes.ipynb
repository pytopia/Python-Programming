It is about focusing on what an object does instead of how it does it, enabling programmers to work with more abstract concepts at a higher level of complexity. Abstraction can be thought of as a natural extension of encapsulation—it involves hiding the internal implementation details of a class and exposing only what is necessary for the outside world to interact with the object.\n"

By defining clear contracts that subclasses must adhere to, developers can create flexible and interchangeable components that improve the maintainability and scalability of software systems. Although Python's approach to interfaces is somewhat informal compared to languages with explicit interface constructs, it is no less effective in fostering robust object-oriented design principles."

    "1. **Framework Development:**\n",
    "   ABCs and interfaces are extensively used in frameworks to define a set of base functionalities that can be extended by the user. For instance, in a web framework, abstract classes may define the structure of a model or controller, which developers can then subclass to suit their specific application needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Plugin Systems and Extensions:**\n",
    "   They enable the creation of flexible plugin systems, where plugins are required to implement specific interfaces. This allows the main application to interact with an unknown number of plugins, provided they adhere to the defined interface, thus enhancing extensibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Ensuring Consistency Across Different Modules:**\n",
    "   By enforcing a common set of methods across various classes, abstract classes and interfaces ensure consistency and predictability in how different parts of a system interact, significantly reducing integration bugs.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Unit Testing and Mocking:**\n",

    "\n",
    "2. **Performance Considerations:**\n",
    "   While generally not significant, the abstraction layer introduced by abstract classes and interfaces can impact performance. In performance-critical applications, the overhead of method calls through these abstractions might be a concern.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Rigidity of Structure:**\n",
    "   Once an abstract class or interface is widely used within a project, changing its structure (e.g., adding or modifying methods) can be difficult, especially if the changes break backward compatibility. This can lead to a more rigid structure that's harder to evolve over time.\n",

You will learn more about this in the upcoming lectures.\n",

They provide a template that outlines a set of methods (and perhaps properties) that are common across a set of related classes. The abstract class itself does not provide implementations for all of its methods—those marked as abstract methods—thus, it hides the internal implementation details from the user.\n",

This definition of an interface is essential for abstraction because it ensures that no matter how a subclass implements the details, the user can expect the same set of operations to be available. This is the \"hiding details\" part of abstraction, where users or client code interact with a consistent interface (the what) without needing to understand the specific implementations (the how) by subclasses.\n"
