    "In Python, polymorphism manifests itself in several ways, reflecting the language's dynamic and flexible nature. At its core, polymorphism allows for the expression of a single interface for entities of different types. This is best illustrated through two primary aspects:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Method Overriding**: This occurs in the context of inheritance, where a method in a subclass has the same name, parameters, and return type as a method in its superclass, but the implementation differs. This characteristic of polymorphism allows a subclass to customize or completely replace the behavior of a method defined in its superclass.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Duck Typing**: Python is known for its \"duck typing\" philosophy, encapsulated in the saying, \"If it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it's a duck.\" This means that the suitability of an object for a particular operation is determined by the presence of certain methods and properties, rather than the object's type itself being of primary concern. This trait allows for a more flexible and intuitive way to apply polymorphism.\n"
