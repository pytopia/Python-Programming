This makes it convenient to access and organize your code, data, and supporting files.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Extensions and Customization:** Jupyter Lab supports a wide range of extensions that enhance its functionality. You can customize the appearance, add new features, and integrate additional tools seamlessly within the interface. This flexibility enables you to tailor Jupyter Lab according to your specific needs and preferences.\n"
